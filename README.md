# SSJ Plugin: Add Tools
A convenient script that lets you add more tools to [SSJ](https://github.com/thirdbyte/ssj) that are not a part of the `kali-linux-large` metapackage.

Once the [installation](https://github.com/thirdbyte/ssj#installation) is completed, follow the below steps:
1. `git clone https://github.com/thirdbyte/ssj-plugin-add-tools && cd ssj-plugin-add-tools`
2. Edit the `tools.txt` file and list all the tools, one in a line, that you want to add.
3. `chmod +x add-tools.sh && ./add-tools.sh`
